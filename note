# 关闭 apple 的特殊渲染
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 AppleFontSmoothing -int 0

There are five settings for font smoothing:
Automatic - Best for Main Display

	Standard - Best for CRT (option 1)
	Light (option 2)
	Medium - Best for Flat Panel (option 3)
	Strong (option 4)

	To tightly control this so that you are no longer in the automatic world, use Terminal.app to change the
	property system-wide. I suspect if you do this, the display switching (between monitors and I suspect
	perhaps your screen saver for suspend/resume) should no longer mess with your settings.

In Terminal.app, enter:

	defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2

To have launchd start postgresql at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

    Then to load postgresql now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
